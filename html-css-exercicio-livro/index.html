              Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
              for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style
              Sheets (CSS) and Javascript it forms a triad of cornerstone
              technologies for the World Wide Web.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-text">
              &emsp; HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With
              HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive
              forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means
              to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
              for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
              other itens. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using
              angle brackets. Tags such as
              <span class="code-marks">&nbsp&ltimg /&gt&nbsp</span> and
              <span class="code-marks">&nbsp&ltinput /&gt&nbsp</span> introduce
              content into the page directly. Others such as
              <span class="code-marks">&nbsp&ltp&gt...&ltp /&gt&nbsp</span>
              surround and provide information about document text and may
              include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the
              HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-text">
              &emsp; HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language
              such as Javascript which affect the behavior and content of web
              pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
              The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintener of both the HTML
              and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
              presentational HTML since 1997.

              &emsp; In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN,
              proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to
              use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
              proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee
              specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late
              1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert
              Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the
              project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes
              from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is
              used" and put an encyclopedia first.

            <p class="chapter-text">
              &emsp; After the HTML and HTML+ draft expired in early 1994, the
              IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML
              2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a
              standard against which future implementations should be based.
